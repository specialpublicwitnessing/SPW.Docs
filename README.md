# Welcome to the SPW Project

## Introduction

**Special Public Witnessing (SPW)** is an application developed to assist Jehovah's Witnesses in managing carts and displays used in public preaching. With an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, SPW allows you to organize and track the availability, location, and use of carts, helping to keep the preaching work more efficient and organized.
